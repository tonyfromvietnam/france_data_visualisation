<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project illustrates my knowledge about the basic data visualisation in Matplotlib; using additional libraries, including pandas & numpy.
This project contains:
* A python file: plot.py. This file demonstrates the use of libraries in visualising the needed graph. This graph is about the location of big cities, in which the population is above 5000 in France in 1999.
* A CSV file: france.csv. This file is the data file, which I found and download from Kaggle (a sharing data site). [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/french-cities-population-lat-long-1999) to the dataset.
* Two png files: Route_of_the_1999_Tour_de_France.png & France_Visualisation.png. The file France_Visualisation.png is the resulting graph from the python code, compared to the real locations of cities in France (by using the map of the 1999 Tour de France).
This project aims to get used to the additional libraries, which are useful in data manipulating & data visualisation: matplotlib, pandas, numpy.
